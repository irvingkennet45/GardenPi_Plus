# Logic Directory

This folder contains the main MicroPython modules that power the GardenPi+ device.

- **main.py** - entry point with the web server and automation logic.
- **action_handler.py** - placeholder for future GPIO action abstractions.
- **auth_handler.py** - placeholder for a dedicated authentication module.
- **sensor.py** - placeholder for sensor management logic.

These modules run on a Raspberry Pi Pico W. The project is experimental and currently in alpha. See the top-level README for setup instructions.
